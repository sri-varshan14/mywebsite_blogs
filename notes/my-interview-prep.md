# My Interview Preparation

As I am  about to complete my Final of bachelor degree, I am thinking of applying for internship in companies. Note this is not the first time I am learning this concept I have a understanding of most of the problem and firm understanding of C. So I mention that this is revision of Data Structure and Algorithm. I am just preparing these notes so that it might help other students who are studying.

Also I want to mention that I am following a book *Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy Data Structures and Algorithmic Puzzles* by *Narasimha Karumanchi* . Mostly I this post is contents are structure similar to that of the book. Consider buying a copy of the book to go along with this <3.
