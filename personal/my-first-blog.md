# My First Blog

## Introduction

Welcome, fellow travelers of the digital realm! I'm Srivarshan, and it's a pleasure to have you stumble upon my digital abode. As I pen down my inaugural blog, let me invite you into my world, offering insights into my passions, aspirations, and the exciting journey ahead.

Hailing from the bustling metropolis of Chennai, India, my educational journey has led me to the brink of completing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Anna University, Trichy. However, my real foray into the world of programming and technology has been largely self-driven. While formal education provided the structure, my true learning came from my insatiable curiosity and relentless pursuit of knowledge.

## What I Do?

My coding odyssey spans across multiple languages—C/C++, Python, Rust, and JavaScript. The intricate symphony of C and C++ feels like second nature, while Rust has captured my interest, serving as the backbone for my ongoing exploration into backend API development. I also keep a keen eye on languages like Ziglang and Carbon, intrigued by their potential.

Venturing beyond the confines of code, I am equally enamored with the harmonies of programming and the melodious world of music. For almost four years, Linux—Arch, to be exact—has been my primary platform, offering the flexibility and customization I cherish. Backend development, particularly in Rust or TypeScript, resonates deeply with me, and I tend to gravitate away from Java whenever feasible. Presently, my website's backend thrives on TypeScript, owing to current server limitations, hosted graciously by Vercel. Postgres serves as the foundation of my database, complemented by TRPC for API and NextJS for frontend work—although, I confess, Svelte does hold a special allure. Apologies, NextJS!

My heart beats for Computer Vision—a realm where the marriage of mathematics and image manipulation creates a breathtaking symphony. Despite being a somewhat overlooked subject, I devote a significant portion of my time to self-learning and hands-on implementation. My ambitions include crafting impactful projects leveraging Neural Networks and diving into AI research, albeit perhaps in the future. For now, my focus lies in honing my backend coding skills, paving the way toward my first role as a software developer. My journey is a work in progress, aimed at making substantive contributions to the fascinating world of computer vision.

## Mom, My Forever Gratitude

In the midst of this whirlwind, I must shine a light on my greatest pillar of strength—my mother. Her unwavering support, both emotionally and financially, is the bedrock upon which my endeavors stand. Mom, if these words find you, know that my gratitude knows no bounds.

## Conclusion

As this introduction draws to a close, let's remember that while the allure of the internet is undeniable, our own paths beckon us earnestly. It's time for me to dive back into the unique tapestry of my own endeavors. Until our paths cross again, take care and keep exploring!
