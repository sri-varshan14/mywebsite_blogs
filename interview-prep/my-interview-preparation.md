# My Interview Preparation

Now, I am at my final year of my bachelors degree. I thinking of applying for internship in company. So I am preparing for my Interview. So I decided to compose all the topic I revise once again in this blog posts. I Hope it helps someone.

Actually I am preparing with a book which goes by the name *Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy Data Structures and Algorithmic Puzzles* by *Narasimha Karumanchi* actually it's not my first time reading this concept. I am just revising this So It's advice to have a basic Idea of programming and Data Structure and Algorithm before going through this blogs.

I am thinking of structuring the blogs based on the Contents of the book. I highly recommend you to buy a copy of the book to get more familiarity.
